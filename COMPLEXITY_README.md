# SonarQube Complexity Demonstration Project

This project has been enhanced to demonstrate various SonarQube use cases by implementing highly complex functions that intentionally exceed recommended complexity thresholds. This serves as a learning tool for understanding how SonarQube identifies and reports code quality issues.

## üéØ Project Overview

The project now includes five complex components that showcase different types of complexity patterns that SonarQube will flag:

### Components with High Complexity

### Best Practices (What NOT to Do)

This project intentionally violates these practices for demonstration:

‚ùå **Don't:** Write functions with 500+ lines
‚úÖ **Do:** Keep functions under 50 lines

‚ùå **Don't:** Nest conditions 6+ levels deep  
‚úÖ **Do:** Use early returns and guard clauses

‚ùå **Don't:** Mix multiple responsibilities in one function
‚úÖ **Do:** Follow Single Responsibility Principle

‚ùå **Don't:** Create complex boolean expressions
‚úÖ **Do:** Extract boolean logic into well-named variables

‚ùå **Don't:** Write code without considering testability
‚úÖ **Do:** Write small, testable functions
